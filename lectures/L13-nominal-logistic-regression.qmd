## Introduction {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- We have discussed binary logistic regression for binomial outcomes,

$$\ln \left( \frac{\pi}{1-\pi} \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + ... + \beta_k x_k$$

- We have also discussed ordinal logistic regression for ordinal outcomes,

$$\ln \left( \frac{\pi_1 + ... + \pi_j }{\pi_{j+1} + ... + \pi_{c}} \right) = \hat{\beta}_{0j} + \hat{\beta}_{1} x_1 + ... + \hat{\beta}_{k} x_k$$

- Today, we will discuss nominal logistic regression for multinomial outcomes,

$$\ln \left( \frac{\pi_j}{\pi_{\text{ref}}} \right) = \hat{\beta}_{0j} + \hat{\beta}_{1j} x_1 + ... + \hat{\beta}_{kj} x_k$$

## Nominal (or Multinomial) Logistic Regression {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Like in ordinal logistic regression, we will create $c-1$ models.

    - Unlike ordinal logistic regression, we no longer assume proportional odds.
    
    - This means that we now have different slopes for each model constructed.
    
$$\ln \left( \frac{\pi_j}{\pi_{\text{ref}}} \right) = \hat{\beta}_{0j} + \hat{\beta}_{1j} x_1 + ... + \hat{\beta}_{kj} x_k$$

- We will now use the `multinom()` function from the `nnet` package.

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(nnet)
m <- multinom(outcome ~ var_1 + var_2 + ... + var_k, 
              data = dataset)
```

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Setup

Let's consider data from a General Social Survey, relating political ideology to political party affiliation. Political ideology has a five-point ordinal scale, ranging from very liberal ($Y=1$) to very conservative ($Y=5$). Let $x$ be an indicator variable for political party, with $x = 1$ for Democrats and $x = 0$ for Republicans. We will construct an ordinal logistic regression model that models political ideology as a function of political party and sex.

## Data

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(gsheet)
library(tidyverse)
gss <- gsheet2tbl("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QgTiSaxVkZvLs9guX-pnAxln0hn4Xtsa1DiRGjcKXsM/edit?usp=sharing") %>%
  mutate(Ideology = as.factor(Ideology))
head(gss)
```

## Code

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(gsheet)
library(tidyverse)
gss <- gsheet2tbl("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QgTiSaxVkZvLs9guX-pnAxln0hn4Xtsa1DiRGjcKXsM/edit?usp=sharing") %>%
  mutate(Ideology = as.factor(Ideology))
head(gss)
```

- Let's model ideology as a function of political party affiliation and sex.

## R output

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(nnet)
m1 <- multinom(Ideology ~ Party + Sex,
                 data = gss)
summary(m1)
```

## Resulting Models

$$
\begin{align*}
  \ln \left( \frac{\pi_{\text{Lib}}}{\pi_{\text{V. Lib}}} \right) &= 0.07 + 0.42 \text{ republican} - 0.14 \text{ male} \\
  \ln \left( \frac{\pi_{\text{Mod}}}{\pi_{\text{V. Lib}}} \right) &= 0.90 + 0.86 \text{ republican} - 0.37 \text{ male} \\
  \ln \left( \frac{\pi_{\text{Cons}}}{\pi_{\text{V. Lib}}} \right) &= -0.74 + 1.68 \text{ republican} + 0.16 \text{ male} \\
  \ln \left( \frac{\pi_{\text{V. Cons}}}{\pi_{\text{V. Lib}}} \right) &= -0.41 + 1.56 \text{ republican} + 0.08 \text{ male}
\end{align*}
$$

## Code

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(nnet)
m1 <- multinom(Ideology ~ Party + Sex,
                 data = gss)

## Interpretations {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Continuous Predictors

- For a one [predictor unit] increase in [predictor], the odds of [response category $j$], as compared to [the reference category], are multiplied by e$^{\hat{\beta}_i}$.
    
- For a one [predictor unit] increase in [predictor], the odds of [response category $j$], as compared to [the reference category], are [increased or decreased] by [100(e$^{\hat{\beta}_i}$-1)\% or 100(1-e$^{\hat{\beta}_i}$)\%].
    
## Categorical Predictors

- As compared to [reference category of predictor], the odds of [response category $j$], as compared to [reference category of outcome], for [predictor category of interest] are multiplied by e$^{\hat{\beta}_i}$.
    
- As compared to [reference category of predictor], the odds of [response category $j$], as compared to [reference category of outcome], for [predictor category of interest] are [increased or decreased] by [100(e$^{\hat{\beta}_i}$-1)\% or 100(1-e$^{\hat{\beta}_i}$)\%].  

:::

## Example {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Let's look at interpreting our models.

```{r}
round(exp(coefficients(m1)), 2)
```

- **Specific:** As compared to someone who identifies as a democrat, someone who identifies as republican has a 377% increase in the odds of saying their political ideology is very conservative as compared to very liberal.

- **More general:** As compared to identifying as having a very liberal political ideology, those that identify as republican have increased odds of reporting more conservative political ideologies.

## Inference - Hypothesis Testing {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- As we saw, the results from `summary()` do not include hypothesis test results.

## Global Level

- To determine global significance, we will use full/reduced ANOVA.

```{r}
#| eval: false
full <- multinom(outcome ~ var_1 + var_2 + ... + var_k, data = dataset)
reduced <- multinom(outcome ~ var_1 + var_2 + ... + var_(k-1), data = dataset)
anova(reduced, full, test = "Chisq")
```

## Model Level

- We will construct p-values "by hand" for the individual models.

```{r}
#| eval: false
m <- multinom(outcome ~ var_1 + var_2 + ... + var_k, data = dataset)
z <- summary(m1)$coefficients/summary(m1)$standard.errors # construct z
p <- (1 - pnorm(abs(z)))*2 # construct p-values
t(p) # transpose to columns
```

:::

## Example {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Let's explore significance for our models.

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Global Level - Party

- To determine global significance, we will use full/reduced ANOVA.

```{r}
ddpcr::quiet(f <- multinom(Ideology ~ Party + Sex, data = gss))
ddpcr::quiet(r <- multinom(Ideology ~ Sex, data = gss))
anova(r, f, test = "Chisq")
```

## Global Level - Sex

- To determine global significance, we will use full/reduced ANOVA.

```{r}
ddpcr::quiet(f <- multinom(Ideology ~ Party + Sex, data = gss))
ddpcr::quiet(r <- multinom(Ideology ~ Party, data = gss))
anova(r, f, test = "Chisq")
```

## Model Level

- Again, we are constructing p-values "by hand" for the individual models.

```{r}
z <- summary(m1)$coefficients/summary(m1)$standard.errors # construct z
p <- (1 - pnorm(abs(z)))*2 # construct p-values
t(p) # transpose to columns
```

## Results

- Globally, only political party is a significant predictor of political ideology ($p < 0.001$).

- This holds true when comparing moderate ($p < 0.001$), conservative ($p < 0.001$), and very conservative ($p < 0.001$) to very liberal.

:::

## Inference - Hypothesis Testing {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- What if we are interested in comparing against, say, moderate ideology?

    - We would restructure the data such that moderate would be the "first" category that R saw.
    
- Global significance will not change.

- Model level significance will change.

    - This is because we are now comparing the outcomes to moderates, instead of very liberal.

## Inference - Confidence Intervals {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Like before, we can construct confidence intervals using the `confint()` function.

- We, of course, want the confidence intervals of the odds ratios.

```{r}
round(exp(confint(m1)),2)
```

## Wrap Up {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- We have now covered logistic regression for all types of categorical outcomes.

    - Two responses $\to$ binary logistic regression.
    
    - More than two ordered* responses $\to$ ordinal logistic regression.
    
        - *: if we do not meet the proportional odds assumption, ignore ordering.
    
    - More than two responses $\to$ nominal logistic regression.
    
- Note that we have learned the models with a *logit* link function.

    - We can also use *probit* and *complementary log log* (cloglog) link functions.
    
    - You can read a discussion about the differences [on stack overflow](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/20523/difference-between-logit-and-probit-models)

## Introduction {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Recall the general linear model, 

$$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + ... + \beta_k x_k + \varepsilon $$

- Last lecture, we begain talking about interactions and focused on continuous $\times$ continuous interactions.

    - e.g., $x_1 \times x_2$
    
- Today, we will begin talking about interactions with categorical variables.

## Interactions with Categorical Variables {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Recall that if a categorical predictor with $c$ classes is included in the model, we will include $c-1$ terms to represent it.

- This holds true for interactions: 

    - Categorical $\times$ categorical: $(c_1-1)(c_2-1)$
    
    - Categorical $\times$ continuous: $(c-1)(1)$

- Note that a special (and easy!) case is when our categorical variable is binary: $c-1 = 1$.

- Consider factor A, with 3 levels, and factor B, with 4 levels.

    - 2 $\times$ 3 = 6 terms in the model ðŸ˜¬

## Example 1 - Model {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Let's model the average rating as a function of if the game was made in the last 10 years (*year2013*), if I can play it at home (*play_home*), the length of game play (*play_hours* - categorical!), the interaction between if I can play it at home and if the game was made in the last 10 years, and the interaction between if I can play it at home and the length of game play.

m1 <- lm(average ~ year2013 + play_home + play_hours_2 + play_hours_3 + play_hours_4 + play_hours_5 +
           play_home:year2013 + # interaction between play_home and year2013
           play_home:play_hours_2 + play_home:play_hours_3 + play_home:play_hours_4 + play_home:play_hours_5, # interaction between play_home and play_hours

## Testing Categorical $\times$ Categorical Interactions {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- As we see in the model, a categorical $\times$ categorical interaction results in $(c_1-1)(c_2-1)$ terms.

    - In our example, `play_home` $\times$ `play_hours` results in 4 terms.
    
- If we want to know if the interaction - overall - is significant, then we must perform the partial F test.

    - The reduced model removes *only* the terms related to the *specific interaction* we are interested in.
    
        - e.g., in our example, we would remove `play_home:play_hours_2`, `play_home:play_hours_3`, `play_home:play_hours_4`, `play_home:play_hours_5` to determine if the interaction between `play_home` and `play_hours` is significant.
        
- Note that in the case of binary $\times$ binary *or* binary $\times$ continuous interactions, we can use the results from `summary()`.

## Example 1 - Testing {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Let's determine which interactions are significant.

## Wrap Up {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- What we have learned about interactions holds true *regardless* of the type of modeling we are doing.

    - We may not explicitly talk about interactions in the future, however, it is valid to be asked to include them in models.

- Today's activity:

    - Continue to model using the penguin data.
    
    - You'll now be including catgorical interaction terms in the model.
